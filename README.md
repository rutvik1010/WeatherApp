Weather application in Python

A weather application in Python using the  Yahoo API for weather(For Live weather), wikiapi and  the pygame library(For the GUI).The application also has background music and a wikipedia random article generator.

Some of the functionalities in this project might not work as I have stopped updating the code for this application. 

The initial project plan is in the 'Flow' file and the 'Screenshot' file has a screenshot of the application.
