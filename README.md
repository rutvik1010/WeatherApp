WeatherApp

Some of the functionalities in this project might not work(I have stopped updating the code) as I am currently learning new libraries, languages and doing other projects.

A project using the  Yahoo API for weather, wikiapi and  the pygame library.
The app wil also have background music and a wikipedia random article generator(with an option to move to the next article).

The project plan is showed in the 'Flow' file and the 'Screenshot' file shows the app in action.
